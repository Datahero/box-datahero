<!-- Datahero #1233: We use Typekit "proxima-nova" webfont on site, but Typekit is DNS-limitted to datahero.com.
                     Phantom.js renders site from localhost.com, so it doesn't have access to Typekit webfont.
                     Proxima Nova ttf files should be installed locally on Ubuntu machine (see "Manually Install Multiple Fonts"
                     here: http://www.wikihow.com/Install-TrueType-Fonts-on-Ubuntu ), but when the css references
                     "proxima-nova", phantom.js doesn't make the match to "Proxima Nova" font.

                     To solve this, this file (to be put at ~/.fonts.conf) aliases "proxima-nova" to "Proxima Nova",
                     making all the css definitions work even though they're designed for the Typekit version.

                     To test this is working, run the phantom font-test script: 
                       $ cd www/scripts/phantom/
                       $ phantomjs ./font-test-phantom.js
                     This creates a test image in the directory called font-test.png.  SCP it to your local machine,
                     open it up, and make sure it's rendered in Proxima Nova (you can examine the 'Q', for example).
                     If it looks like Proxima Nova, the "proxima-nova" alias is installed correctly.
